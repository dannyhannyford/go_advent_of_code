# Notes 
strings.Indexbyte is for single byte characters
faster than strings.Index

for loop even faster

# Strings
read in bytes, need to be careful of multi-byte characters, use Runes if outside normal english

%T = type
%v = value

x := 10
fmt.Printf("%T, %v, x, x)

Output:
int, 10

strconv.Atoi is short for strconv.ParseInt(s,10,0)
